# Dius checkout 

Simple checkout system built with Typescript.

## Prerequisites 

- OSX or a standard Linux distribution 
- Node.js 10+, I recommend installing Node via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

## Setup

`npm install`

## Run

`npm test`

## Assumptions

Assumes pricing manager will be using a CMS-esque system to manage pricing rules and thus the JSON the frontend provides will be consistent across all pricing rules
